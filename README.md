# ARMA 3 Camo Mod Maker

A standalone application that allows you to create a uniform addon for ARMA 3 based on a custom texture file.

## Installation

**Supported OS:** Currently, only Windows OS is supported. Future updates may include support for MacOS and Linux.

**Prerequisites:** 
- Ensure [Arma 3 Tools](https://store.steampowered.com/app/233800/Arma_3_Tools/) is installed on your machine.

**Steps:**
1. Download the latest version from the [Releases Page](https://github.com/bijx/ARMA-3-Camo-Mod-Maker/releases). Extract the ZIP file to a preferred location on your machine.
1. In order for the application to properly convert images to .paa textures, you will need to have [Arma 3 Tools](https://store.steampowered.com/app/233800/Arma_3_Tools/) installed on your machine.
   - Go to `C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common` or the directory where your `steamapps` are located.
   - Open the **Arma 3 Tools** directory and locate the `TexView2` folder.
   - Copy `Pal2PacE.exe` from the `TexView2` folder and paste it into the `vendor` folder of the Camo Mod Maker app (`\CamoModMaker-win32-x64\resources\app\vendor`). Use the `place_Pal2PacE.exe_here` file as a guide for the correct location.
1. Launch the application by running `CamoModMaker.exe` from the root folder (`CamoModMaker-win32-x64`).

## Usage

### Generating the Mod
1. Input a name for your mod in the `Mod Name` field.
1. Fill in your username in the `Author Name` field for in-game credit.
1. Use the `Choose File` button to select a texture file. Optimal textures are square, at least 1024x1024px, and preferably tileable.
   - Find and download free-to-use textures from my [Camouflage Blueprint Maker](https://bijx.github.io/Camouflage-Blueprint-Generator/) project!
1. Choose the addons to include in your mod. The `Base Uniform` is always included; additional equipment options are available.
1. Optional: The `Blend Uniform with Normal` feature combines your texture with the base normal map for added detail such as pocket outlines and fabric wrinkles. Experiment to see which setting suits your needs.
1. Click "Create Mod" and wait for the confirmation message. Processing time varies based on the number of selected addons. Encounter any issues? Report them [here](https://github.com/bijx/ARMA-3-Camo-Mod-Maker/issues).

### Packaging the Mod

Follow these steps to package your mod:

1. **Locate the Created Mod:**
   - After creation, your mod will be a ZIP file in the `\CamoModMaker-win32-x64\resources\app\` directory.

2. **Prepare the Mod Folders:**
   - Move the ZIP file to an empty folder on your machine and extract it. You will get two folders named after your class, one of which is prefixed with an `@` symbol.

3. **Set Up the Addon Builder:**
   - Open **Arma 3 Tools** and start the **Addon Builder**.
   - In `Addon Source Directory`, enter the path to the folder without the `@` symbol.
   - In `Destination Directory or Filename`, enter the path to the `Addons` folder inside the folder with the `@` symbol.
     - Example: If your mod is named `EpicUSMod`, set up the Addon Builder as shown:

4. **Build the Mod:**
   - Click the `Pack` button in the Addon Builder and wait for the confirmation of a successful build.

5. **Load the Mod in Arma 3:**
